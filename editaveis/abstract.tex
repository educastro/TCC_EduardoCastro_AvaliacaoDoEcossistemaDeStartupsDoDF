Taking the momemtum with many initiatives fostering and supporting Startups in Brasilia, this work aims to conduct an assessment of the current state of Startup Ecosystem in Brasília using a methodology created by InovaSampa research group, from University of São Paulo, through a qualitative study based on interviews with several local entrepreneurs.
